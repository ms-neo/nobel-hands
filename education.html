                    <h2>Education of Children </h2>
                    <p>Poverty has become a sensitive and ever remained issue almost in all developing countries of
                        the world. Education plays a vital role in poverty alleviation.
                        In Pakistan, the demand for education is strong but the public sector has been unable to
                        deliver,
                        due to poor management and corruption. As a result, due to poverty, the illiteracy rate
                        particularly of women is very high in the country. Since 1980, the number of private schools in
                        Pakistan has grown from about 3,000 to about 50,000.</p>

                        <h2>Transportation</h2>
                        <p>There are many families in villages who can’t send their kids to public schools due to lack
                            of
                            transport. Most people have no option but to hire private bus or van companies so their kids
                            coud go to nearby city or town. Poor families can’t afford this extra cost associated with
                            the
                            education of their kids. As a result, a vicious cicrle of poverty and lack of development
                            continues.</p>

                    <p>A survey showed that about one in five of Pakistan’s poorest families sends their children to
                        private village schools. It is estimated that 1 in 10 children out of school live in Pakistan.
                        It is
                        an
                        alarming number and efforts should be made to help these poor communities. Few charities
                        have set up private schools where running projects offer financial support to schools. But it is
                        still only a drop in the ocean.</p>

                    <p>It doesn’t take a lot to help poor families and and get their children educated. Education can
                        change
                        their lives, for good.
                        Noblehands.org has joined hands to fight this cycle of poverty and give these kids a better
                        future.
                        We are helping these families to stand on their feet by buying them animals in villages. These
                        animals can provide milk to the family. That milk is used by the family and they can sell extra
                        milk
                        to make some extra money for food, clothing and other expenses.</p>
